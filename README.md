# shoppingbasket

This repository contains a simple shopping basket application that is used as a
Java coding exercise for recruitment purposes. For that reason the code and
tests _may_ be incomplete and (maybe) not all of the tests work! This README
defines a brief for the candidate, and what the _required_ usage and behaviour
of the application is.

# Technology Stack Used
* Java 8
* Spring
* Hibernate
* JPA
* MySql
* Spring Security


# Usage

#### To run the application check out the code and adjust database settings in this file

/domain/src/main/resources/application.properties

#### After run this class
/web/src/main/java/com.karen.shoppingbasket/ShoppingBasketApplciation.class


# MORE
### Plans to add integration tests and improve exception handling when I will have a time :)
